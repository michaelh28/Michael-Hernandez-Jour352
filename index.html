Co-Editor in Chief
La Voz Unida
January 2020- Present

My job consists of managing a team of writers, photographers, editors, and business staff. I co-lead weekly meetings where we discuss topic ideas and assign stories to writers.  Throughout the writing process I assist the writers with any questions or concerns they may have. I also make sure deadlines are met and that articles have been edited for accuracy, grammar and style.

Editor in Chief
La Esquina Latina
May 2017-June 2018
I managed a team of writers and helped them produce news articles that were relevant to the Latino community at my high school. Every month I led a story session where writers pitched news ideas. I then chose the articles that would be in that cycle. I guided the writers in the right direction by hinting at potential sources and assisting them with any obstacles. During the final stage of the writing process I suggested several revisions to their articles. I also designed the pages in In InDesign and created a budget that outlined where each story would go.

I wrote for the Spanish section of my high school’s award-winning newspaper. Throughout the year I wrote different types of articles that were relevant to the Latino community. I worked closely with my colleagues to produce quality journalistic content.
