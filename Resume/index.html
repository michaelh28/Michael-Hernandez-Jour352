<h2>Experience:</h2>

<!-- First job -->
<h3>Co-Editor in Chief</h3>
<h4>La Voz Unida</h4>
<h5>January 2020- Present</h5>

<p>My job consists of managing a team of writers, photographers, editors, and business staff. I also co-lead weekly meetings where we discuss topic ideas and assign stories to writers.  Throughout the writing process I assist the writers with any questions or concerns they may have. In addition, I make sure deadlines are met and that articles have been edited for accuracy, grammar and style.</p>

<!-- Second job -->
<h3>Editor in Chief</h3>
<h4>La Esquina Latina</h4>
<h5>May 2017-June 2018</h5>
<p>I managed a team of writers and produced news articles that were relevant to the Latino community at my high school. Every month I led a story session where writers pitched news ideas. I then chose the articles that would be in that cycle. I guided the writers in the right direction by hinting at potential sources and assisting them with any obstacles. During the final stage of the writing process I suggested several revisions to their articles. I also designed the pages in In InDesign and created a budget that outlined where each story would go.</p>

<h3>Writer</h3>
<h4>La Esquina Latina</h4>
<h5>May 2016- May 2017</h5>
<p>I wrote for the Spanish section of my high schoolâ€™s award-winning newspaper. Throughout the year I wrote different types of articles that were relevant to the Latino community. I worked closely with my colleagues to produce quality journalistic content.</p>


<h3>Law Intern</h3>
<h4>HMS Host</h4>
<h5>July 2016-August 2016</h5>
<p>Over a period of two months I worked closely with the law department of this company. I helped the general counsel with active court cases and learned about different laws in the airport food service industry.</p>
